## MYUTILS

This project holds a list of some functions I worked on while preparing for interviews. These are some random functions which might come in handy in future.

The goal was to learn and understan UV, python project structure and how to import a functions from src directory into main.py. As of now there are no dependencies apart from python.

The plan is to keep adding functions as I learn them.

1- intToRoman(num)
2- romanToInt(s)
3- lengthOfLongestSubstring(s)
4- transpose(matrix)
5- reflect(matrix)
6- maxArea(heights)
7- pallindrome(inp)
